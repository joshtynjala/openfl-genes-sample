# Compile OpenFL with Genes Sample

Compiles an [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) project using the [Genes](https://lib.haxe.org/p/genes) library. When a button is clicked, a new module is loaded from the server at runtime.

Genes modifies the behavior of the Haxe compiler to split the generated JavaScript into modern [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), instead of a single monolithic bundle. This makes it easier to integrate Haxe projects with other tooling from the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Usage

Add the [genes](https://lib.haxe.org/p/genes) Haxelib to your _project.xml_ file:

```xml
<haxelib name="genes"/>
```

Copy the _templates_ directory from this repository to your project. Then, add the following element to your _project.xml_ file:

```xml
<template path="templates" if="html5"/>
```

That's it! You don't need to do anything special to build and run.

```sh
openfl test html5 -debug
```
